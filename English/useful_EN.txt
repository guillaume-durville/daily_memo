We have the GO to continue further investigations by deploying a stable TEST environment 
that will help to build production-grade K8S clusters in the future.
In parallel, we will open a Sandbox K8S cluster to have a self-learning and a playground 
where to test your container workload. You will get details on this very soon ;-)

Please note that we are still missing some elements for a production environment 
(to host production workload). See Questions and Answers slide.

Available mythologies : 
	- Nordic/norse (not so much known outside the classics like Odin, Thor, Yggdrasil)
	- Greek mythology (same thing)
	- Asian legends (uuh how to lose Europe in one clean sweep)?
	
Hydra is a creature/monster.

Idea is good because it illustrates perfectly the relation to a distributed system where heads can regrow. 
It's conceptually very close to what it describes.

Central Monitoring is more about a global vision : 
HYPERION / Jupiter , greek Titan (so it's more dignity than Hydra), father of Helios, Selene, Eos (all important). 
Maybe link to Helios is a conceptual problem ?

-> hyperion is "above all"
Atlas => Monitoring has the weight of all the systems to monitor. Also a Faurecia name ??
I'm sick of people stealing all the good mythology names => get better at mythology.

Heimdall : nice but maybe too connected to pop-culture (MCU) ? 
Also, not so obvious because it's also the floor manager.

Knowing what you don't know is half the battle; this would help you steer your efforts in the right direction

No one got where they are in one day, it needs time and practice



It can be daunting
Tech is changing fast. The way we do things today is completely different from how we used to do them a couple of years ago. 
With so much going on in the tech these days, it can be daunting for anyone beginning their career or even already in this field.


Know what you don't know
Knowing what you don't know is half the battle; this would help you steer your efforts in the right direction. 
These developer roadmaps help you in finding out the missing links, 
identify the loopholes in your knowledge and start improving – whether it is frontend, backend or devops.

Stop worrying, start learning
No one got where they are in one day, it needs time and practice. Let your established ideals not put you off, 
they got to that point with practice; you have to start somewhere. 
Pick a path, identify what you need to know and start improving yourself.
